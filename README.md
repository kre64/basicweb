# basicweb
Getting myself up to speed with basic web programming, with things like html, http, sql-lite, session &amp; cookies, basic web framework.



On a UNIX machine, run "./start.sh" to check for dependencies && run the application.
Required dependencies: Python3, pip3, Flask*

To manually run the application without start.sh;
python init_db.py // Initialize the database file with initial tables
flask run         // Start the Flask application.

*Read http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/#dependencies to check distributions that come with a Flask installation
